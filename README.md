# Real-time Face Mask Detection

## Overview
Face masks help reduce the transmission of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Severe_acute_respiratory_syndrome_coronavirus_2">SARS-CoV-2</a> by interfering with the spread of virus-laden droplets ejected from the nose and mouth. 
Wearing face mask is one of the precautionary steps an individual can take in order to lessen the spread of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus_disease_2019">COVID-19</a>.
In this simple project, a video camera detects if an individual is wearing a face mask or not in real-time.
<br/>The detection steps looks somewhat like this:
